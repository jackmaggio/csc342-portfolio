# Reflection
One challenge I had when implementing Howler was maintaining my current user and the profile user. In order to differentiate between the two, I stored them both within the session storage. This allowed me to maintain which user I was logged in as, while also allowing me to track which profile I was viewing at that time.
An additional feature I would add to Howler would be a user search. Right now, users cannot find other users unless they were already following them or someone they follow is following that person. A user search would allow users to find new members of Howler and view their content.
