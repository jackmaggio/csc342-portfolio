# Homework 0: Thoughts on Ungrading

## 1. What are your thoughts on the Ungrading practice as it applies in general to teaching and learning (not necessarily specifically to this class)?
I think the Ungrading practice will be very beneficial to learning. Grades are a major stressor in college and tend to force students to try and get the best grade rather than learn the material. The Ungrading practice will allow students to focus on learning new material by taking risks on current assignments and remediating mistakes on previous assignments without repercussions.
## 2. What are your thoughts on the way Ungrading will be applied to this class based on what has been explained by your instructor and what is described in the syllabus?
For this class, Ungrading will greatly reduce student's stress and encourage learning. By allowing us to receive feedback and remediate our assignments without consequences, students will be encouraged to actually learn how to develop Web Applications rather than focusing on getting the highest possible grade. The way Ungrading will be applied in this class will allow us to build a portfolio that showcases our new skills without the added stress of letter grades.
## 3. On the scale from 1 to 5, how confident are you in that you can earn an A in this class (1 is lowest, 5 is highest)?
